# PERSONAL-CALENDAR

I've developed my own version of a calendar where you can plan out your day, week, and year. The Modern Calendar App is a feature-rich, user-friendly calendar application designed to streamline your scheduling and organization needs. It offers a seamless and intuitive experience with a React-based frontend and a powerful backend powered by Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
